# Ulam Spiral

## Description
The Ulam Spiral is a visualization technique used in number theory. It is named after the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, who first described it in 1963. The Ulam Spiral represents the sequence of prime numbers in a two-dimensional grid, forming a spiral pattern. This project provides a Java implementation of the Ulam Spiral, allowing you to generate and visualize the spiral pattern.

## Features
- Generate the Ulam Spiral for a given range of numbers.
- Highlight prime numbers in the spiral pattern.
